# We start by loading and instantiating the LLM model. Choosing your model is a big deal,
# and should be done carefully. Look particularly carefully at the licenses, and any 
# restrictions they may place on your use of the model. https://gpt4all.io/ is a good 
# place to start looking. https://huggingface.co/TheBloke is another. At the time of
# writing, GPT4All works best with GGML models quantized down to the q4_0 level, but will
# work (slowly) with finer models up to the q8 level.  The GPT4All desktop application is
# a very convenient way to "test drive" models before deciding which is best for your
# use case.

# Your model will interact according to two key patterns: the system prompt and the user 
# prompt. The former describes the "terms of engagement" that your model will conform to.
# The latter is a fixed format that feeds the user's interaction to the model once for each
# prompt. Both of these will be declared on the model card for the model you choose.
# An interesting consideration is that the model "reads" the system prompt before starting 
# each conversation, at the same speed as it generates tokens. A longer system prompt means 
# a longer startup time for each conversation.
